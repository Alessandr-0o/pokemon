The first step was to load the .jsonl dataset, cleaning the set by eliminating battle 4877 due to its incorrect nature. By creating a vocabulary, we assigned the respective base stats to each Pokémon by exploring \texttt{p1\_team\_detail}, \texttt{p2\_lead\_details}, and the Pokémon present in the \texttt{battle\_timeline} (using the \texttt{build\_species\_index}).

We derived the players' lead speed using \texttt{get\_lead\_speed}, we used the \texttt{track\_pokemon\_conditions} function to summarize the first 30 turns, taking into account the final HP, voluntary switches (excluding KOs) and last-turn effects weighted by 0.5, since we decided to treat effects as having half the impact of status conditions. We also computed the difference between P1 and P2 for the six base stats using the function \texttt{compute\_differences\_base\_stats}.With \texttt{extract\_boost\_difference}, we consider only the stat boosts applied to the Pokémon in the two groups and compute their difference.Using \texttt{extract\_accuracy\_difference}, we evaluate whether each player tended toward risky or safe moves by computing their average move accuracy and returning the difference between the two.

Using the \texttt{create\_feature} function, we merge all the features into a DataFrame, focusing on the first few rows to verify the adequacy of the extracted features. We then created a correlation matrix, noticing identical values, and found a perfect correlation between total\_sp\_attack\_difference and total\_sp\_defense\_difference. To avoid redundancies, we removed total\_sp\_defense\_difference.
